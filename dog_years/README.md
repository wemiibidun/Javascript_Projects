## Hi & Welcome! 👋


**About this Project**

/*Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. A dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life.

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it! With your knowledge of math operators and variables, use JavaScript to convert your human age into dog years.
