## Hi & Welcome! 👋


**About this Project**

A dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life.

The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it!


**Aim**
In this project, my aim is to use JavaScript to show you how to convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:


**What I learnt**

- In this project, I learnt declaration of variables and how to return a string to lowercase

- My knowledge of math operators was also useful here


**My TakeHome**

Javascript can be used to achieve a lot compared to HTML and CSS


**Feedback**

Feedback is always welcome. If you have any to give, please email me via wemiibidun@gmail.com


**Cheers!!!** 😊
